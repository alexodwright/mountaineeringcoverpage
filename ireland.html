        <p>Mangerton, also known as <i>The Long Haired Mountain</i>, is located in County Kerry, in the Mangerton
          Mountain
          Group.
          It stands at a height of 838 metres (2,749 feet), and is the highest in its mountain range. It lies within
          Killarney National
          Park and on it's slopes there sits a corrie or cirque, called the Devil's Punchbowl which is an
          attractive
          tourist destination.
          It is often covered with a blanket of snow
          especially during the Winter months.
        </p>
        <p>It's slopes used to be part of a historical 13th-century battle between the <i lang="ga">Gaelic</i> forces known as the <i
            lang="ga">Mac
            Cárthaigh</i> and the Norman Forces known as the Fitzgeralds.</p>

      <img src="media/torc.jpg" alt="This is a picture of Torc Mountain">
      <div class="text">
        <p>Located in the Killarney National Park, Torc Mountain is an extremely popular route with tourists and locals
          alike, due to its simple ascent with a path of wooden sleepers, and the spectacle of its waterfall.
          At the summit which is 535 meters (1755 feet) above sea level there is a magnificent view of the popular
          Muckross House and the surrounding Killarney town.
        </p>
        <p>
          Torc gets its name from the Irish word <i lang="ga">Torc</i> meaning Boar and it is said that an mystical boar
          was slain here by
          Irish legendary hero, <i lang="ga">Fionn mac Cumhaill</i> who occurs in many other Irish mythological stories.

      <div class="text">
        <p>Croagh Patrick is an important pilgrimage site located in Clew Bay in County Mayo. It has been seen as a holy
          mountain for thousands of years. It became associated with St. Patrick who is said to have fasted there for 40
          days on the summit.
          It is climbed by thousands of people every year on Reek Sunday, the last Sunday of July. This custom has been
          around since at least the Middle Ages.
        </p>
        <p>Its name comes from the Irish <i lang="ga">Cruach Phádraig</i> meaning St. Patrick's stack, but it is known
          locally as 'The Reek'.</p>
