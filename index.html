      <h2>History </h2>
      <p>
        The earliest known records of mountaineering originated were not sporting related; To see if heights were
        haunted,
        to build altars for worship and to get an overview of the surrounding area for battle reasons. All of these
        motives brought
        about the sport of mountaineering. Scientists and Meteorologists would climb peaks to conduct weather readings
        and collect meteorological
        data to make predictions about weather patterns and conclude scientific observations.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first people to climb the highest mountain in the world, Mt.
        Everest, were Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay. They conquered Mt.
        Everest on the 29th of May 1953, after a brutal 16 day ascent to the
        summit of the mountain. This was Norgay's 6th attempt at the climb.
        Reinhold Messner was the first person to climb all 14 mountains that
        stand over 8000 meters or 26,347 feet.

      <h2>Facts and Information</h2>
      <p>
        Mountaineering is considered an extreme sport as it involves
        climbing in harsh conditions and rugged terrain where a lack of
        knowledge or previous experience could hinder the climb. Hazards
        such as rocky cliffs, uneven terrain, extreme weather conditions and
        much more can turn a simple ascent into a fight for survival.
      </p>
      <p>
        Due to the thinning of the air as the altitude increases, climbers
        of Mt. Everest carry oxygen tanks to allow them to breathe for long
        periods of time at the peak. These oxygen tanks weigh at most 8
        pounds or 3.6kg on average. The gear list for such an expedition
        contains equipment such as food, water, clothing, tents, sleeping
        bags, boots, and climbing equipment, in total weighing anywhere from
        35 - 55 pounds or 15 - 25 kg.

      <h2>Techniques</h2>
      <h3>Hiking</h3>
      <p>
        Hiking is probably the most necessary skill to master when it comes to mountaineering.
        Mountains are climbed by repeatedly stepping one foot in front of the other for hours
        at a time with not many breaks. This is performed on long steep slopes that make it easy to lose
        your footing. It is essential you know how to maintain your gear to make the experience as streamlined as
        possible.
      </p>
      <h3>Rock Climbing</h3>
      <p>
        Similarly to hiking, rock climbing is another one of the essential skills needed for mountaineering. However
        it differs
        in the respect that it is mostly hand work. Knowing where to place your hands, how to balance your center of
        mass, and strengthening your grip
        are all a big part of knowing how to rock climb. Rock climbing can be practised indoors at a bouldering gym or
        can be practised at local cliffs.
        There are many activities that fall under the umbrella term of rock climbing such as bouldering and lead
        climbing. Lead climbing involves the use of ropes
        to secure your harness at varying points along the climbing route.
      </p>
      <h3>Absailing</h3>
      <p>
        Finally, absailing is the way to descend after a hard climb. It involves anchoring yourself at the top of a
        cliff face using a tool called belaying anchor, and rapelling
        down, usually if the slope is too steep to descend normally without protection from a harness. It is
        essentially controlled falling using friction to slow yourself down as you fall.
